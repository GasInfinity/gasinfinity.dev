Sami "GasInfinity" Gonzalez Boudrez <<me@gasinfinity.dev>>  

- Daily driving linux since **2015**, discovered nix and its greatness in **2024**
- [Neovim](https://github.com/GasInfinity/Gavin) enjoyer
- Anime [enthusiast](https://myanimelist.net/profile/gasinfinity)
- Gymbro since **2022**

Education:
- **2024-Present** - CS degree at the [Polytechnic University of Valencia](https://www.upv.es)

Old projects (< 18 y.o. and maybe revisited for small changes):
- **[Ink](https://github.com/GasInfinity/Ink)** (MIT): A performance oriented minigame minecraft server implementation in C#.
  - Includes [Ink.Nbt](https://github.com/GasInfinity/Ink.Nbt), which I consider good enough for "general?" use, but needs docs and a better serialization API/structure. 
  - Status: Dropped, major parts of the protocol and server are implemented but I want to work on other projects and things like [Valence](https://valence.rs/) look already very good. 
    - At least I learned some things about networking and code structure.
  
- **Rena**: C# multimedia framework w/batteries included. *Unreleased/local*
  - Includes numerous things like a math library, graphics api abstraction (OGL and D3D11 implemented), windowing api, etc...
  - Status: On hold, considering dropping. Maybe use SDL3 as a backend for Linux. Pending revisit (someday)
